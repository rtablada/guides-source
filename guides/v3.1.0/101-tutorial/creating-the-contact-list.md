Now that we have our HTML and styles all figured out, we'll create our first
component - the `ContactList`. This list is on the left hand side of our
application, and should contain all of the contacts that are available to our
user. But first, let's talk about what components are, and how we can use them
to build applications.

## What is a Component?

Components are Ember's most fundamental construct. They are reusable,
self-contained elements that have a template and optionally a backing class
with any logic that is part of the component's functionality. You can think of
components as extensions to HTML - they allow us to create our own custom tags
like `<div>`, `<input>`, or `<select>`, with custom layouts, styles, and
behaviors.

You can tell whether or not something is a component by looking at it in your
template. Components are invoked using capital-case notation in angle brackets:

```handlebars
<!-- standard HTML div -->
<div>

  <!-- standard HTML input -->
  <input type="checkbox">

  <!-- component -->
  <CustomInput/>

  <!-- block style component -->
  <CustomButton>
    Save
  </CustomButton>

</div>
```

Components allow us to break down our application into reusable and composeable
parts, so we're not repeating ourselves constantly. They give us a way to
encapsulate behavior and keep our code neat and organized.

## Generating a Component

We'll start by using Ember-CLI to generate a basic component for us. Run the
generate command with `component` to get started:

```sh
ember generate component contact-list
```

or, for short:

```sh
ember g component contact-list
```

Ember-CLI should create three files:

```sh
installing component
  create app/components/contact-list.js
  create app/templates/components/contact-list.hbs
installing component-test
  create tests/integration/components/contact-list-test.js
```

The first two files are the template and the backing class for our component,
and the last file is a basic test file. We'll return to testing later on, for
the moment lets focus on the component.

## Adding a Template

Open up the component's template file at `app/templates/components/contact-list`.
You should see one line only with `{{yield}}` in it. This is how components can
use block form, which is when you pass a template to a component upon invocation
(e.g. `<CustomButton>Foo</CustomButton>`). We'll return to this later, for now
remove the `{{yield}}` helper and copy the markup for the contact list from the
application template:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/components/contact-list.hbs" data-diff="-1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9,+10,+11,+12,+13,+14,+15,+16,+17,+18"}
{{yield}}
<nav>
  <input placeholder="search" />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a class="active">
        <h4>Zoey</h4>
        <p>zoey@emberjs.com</p>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a>
        <h4>Tomster</h4>
        <p>tomster@emberjs.com</p>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

And then remove the markup from the application template and replace it with the
`<ContactList>` component:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/application.hbs" data-diff="+2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15,-16,-17,-18,-19"}
<div class="container">
  <ContactList/>
  <nav>
    <input placeholder="search" />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a class="active">
          <h4>Zoey</h4>
          <p>zoey@emberjs.com</p>
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a>
          <h4>Tomster</h4>
          <p>tomster@emberjs.com</p>
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  ...
</div>
```

Save your changes, and you should see the application rebuild and reload.
Everything should appear the exact same as before, and if you inspect the DOM
you'll find that our HTML has remained unchanged:

This is because Ember is rendering the `ContactList` component in the
application template, which puts _its_ template wherever we invoked it. Because
the `ContactList` component only has a template right now, we don't see anything
dynamic. It's just the HTML being inserted directly.

Let's change that!

First, lets add some data to our component. We'll add a couple of JavaScript
objects that represent the contacts in the list, Zoey and Tomster. Open up the
component file at `app/components/contact-list.js` and add a contacts array
to the class:

```js {data-filename="app/components/contact-list.js" data-diff="+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9,+10,+11,+12,+13"}
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default class ContactList extends Component {
  contacts = [
    {
      name: 'Zoey',
      email: 'zoey@emberjs.com',
    },
    {
      name: 'Tomster',
      email: 'tomster@emberjs.com',
    },
  ];
}
```

Now, back in the template, we can loop over this array using the `{{each}}`
helper. This helper recieves an array and a template, and loops over the array,
repeating the template for each item in the array. It yields the item to the
template, so we can dynamically insert the name and email properties of each
item in the template, like so:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/components/contact-list.hbs" data-diff="-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15,+16,+17,+18,+19,+20,+21,+22,+23"}
<nav>
  <input placeholder="search" />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a class="active">
        <h4>Zoey</h4>
        <p>zoey@emberjs.com</p>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a>
        <h4>Tomster</h4>
        <p>tomster@emberjs.com</p>
      </a>
    </li>
    {{#each this.contacts as |contact|}}
      <li>
        <a>
          <h4>{{contact.name}}</h4>
          <p>{{contact.email}}</p>
        </a>
      </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

You should see the same output as before in your browser, only this time it's
dynamic and based on data in your component. There will be one minor difference
here, which is that the first contact will no longer have the `active` class
applied to it. We'll come back to this later once we get the details component
setup. In the meantime, let's add another contact to the list to see it update:

```js {data-filename="app/components/contact-list.js" data-diff="+13,+14,+15,+16"}
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default class ContactList extends Component {
  contacts = [
    {
      name: 'Zoey',
      email: 'zoey@emberjs.com',
    },
    {
      name: 'Tomster',
      email: 'tomster@emberjs.com',
    },
    {
      name: 'Bob',
      email: 'bob@emberjs.com',
    },
  ];
}
```

You should now see "Bob" in the list of contacts:

### What are these curlies?

We already introduced components, which are one of the features of the
Handlebars templating language and are marked by capital-cased elements (like
`<ContactList>`), but in the template above we added three more concepts:

1. **Helpers** like `{{each}}` are like components, but much simpler. They are
are pure functions that take a number of arguments, and in some cases a
template, and return any kind of output. They can be used to format numbers
into currency, to perform boolean logic, to define objects or arrays, or to
fetch data asynchronously.

  Ember comes with a default set of helpers that include some basic operations,
  like `{{each}}`, or `{{if}}` which allows us to conditionally render or hide
  parts of a template. Helpers can receive primitive values (e.g.
  `{{format-number 1234}}`) or variables, which can come from local variables
  provided by yields (see below) or from the backing component class. In our
  example, we pass `this.contacts` to the `{{each}}`, which refers to the
  contacts field we declared in the component body.

  When used with a template (also known as "block form"), helpers must be
  invoked with a hashtag at the beginning (`{{#...}}`), and have a closing
  helper (`{{/...}}`) at the end of the template block, similar to HTML.

2. **Yielding**, which is the `as |contact|` part of the `{{#each}}`. Helpers
and components can both yield values to their template block, giving users
a public API that they can work with in their own usage of the component.

  You can think of components like functions in this way, and yielding is like a
  callback. It allows a higher level component to receive a child template and
  call it where it chooses to fill in details, making components more reusable
  and composeable:

  ```js
    fs.readFile('example.txt', {}, (err, data) => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  ```
  ```handlebars
    <Dropdown as |close|>
      <button onclick={{close}}>
        Close
      </button>
    </Dropdown>
  ```

3. **Bindings** like `{{contact.name}}`. These render the value that they
reference directly into the template, without any formatting, and update the
value in the template as it changes. You'll notice that both of our bindings in
this template refer to `contact`, which is a local variable yielded by
`{{each}}`. Bindings can also refer directly to the component using `{{this}}`
(e.g. `{{this.foo}}`)

Alright, now we're dynamically rendering some HTML based on values in our
JavaScript! Next, let's add some functionality to that search bar so we can
filter through contacts.

## Adding Search Functionality

First, we need to hookup the current `input` to send its value to the component
whenever its updated. Ember ships with a built in `Input` component, which
handles the details of this data binding for us:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/components/contact-list.hbs" data-diff="-2,+3"}
<nav>
  <input placeholder="search" />
  <Input placeholder="search" @value={{searchValue}} />
  <ul>
    {{#each this.contacts as |contact|}}
      <li>
        <a>
          <h4>{{contact.name}}</h4>
          <p>{{contact.email}}</p>
        </a>
      </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Notice how we passed `placeholder` directly to the `Input` component, just like
we passed it to the standard `input` element it replaced, but we added a `@` to
the beginning of `@value`. Ember components can receive two different types of
values: **attributes** and **arguments**.

* **Attributes** are standard HTML attributes, and they are rendered directly
in the component via the `...attributes` syntax. We'll learn more about this
later, but in general attributes are meant to work just like standard HTML
attributes such as `id`, `class`, `role`, aria attributes, data attributes, and
more.

* **Arguments** are values that are passed to the component instance. These can
be any kind of value - strings, numbers, booleans, objects, etc. They are passed
in and the component can use them directly and bind them in its template.

The `Input` component receives a `@value` argument which it binds to the `input`
tag in its template. This binding is bi-directional - when you update the value
of the `input` tag, it is communicated upwards by the `Input` component and
modified in the surrounding context (in this case, the `ContactList` component).
It's absolutely possible to have a uni-directional binding, where updating a
value in a child component will _not_ automatically update the parent component,
but most often for HTML inputs bi-directional binding is the behavior we want,
so `Input` implements it this way to save some boilerplate. We'll discuss
uni-directional data flow (also known as Data Down, Actions Up) later on.

Now that we have the search value in our component, we need to use it to
actually filter the list. To do that, we'll use a computed property:

```js {data-filename="app/components/contact-list.js" data-diff="+2,+20,+21,+22,+23,+24,+25,+26,+27,+28,+29,+30,+31"}
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { computed } from '@ember-decorators/object';

export default class ContactList extends Component {
  contacts = [
    {
      name: 'Zoey',
      email: 'zoey@emberjs.com',
    },
    {
      name: 'Tomster',
      email: 'tomster@emberjs.com',
    },
    {
      name: 'Bob',
      email: 'bob@emberjs.com',
    },
  ];

  @computed('contacts', 'searchValue')
  get filteredContacts() {
    // Turn the search string into a case-insensitive,
    // regular expression so we can match without
    // worrying about case
    let searchRegex = new RegExp(this.searchValue, 'i');

    return this.contacts.filter(contact => {
      return searchRegex.test(contact.name)
        || searchRegex.test(contact.email);
    });
  }
}
```

As you can see, `filteredContacts` is a standard class getter function, and it
returns the `contacts` array filtered by the `searchValue`. The only unusual
thing we've added here is the `@computed` decorator. This decorator memoizes the
getter - it caches its value until one of the dependent keys passed to it (in
this case, `'contacts'` and `'searchValue'`) changes. This way we don't do more
work than we need to. It also allows Ember to know when a value has updated and
when it needs to rerender, otherwise it wouldn't know to rerender the `each`
loop when `searchValue` changes.

Let's update the template to use our new `filteredContacts` property:

```handlebars {data-filename="app/templates/components/contact-list.hbs" data-diff="-4,+5"}
<nav>
  <Input placeholder="search" @value={{searchValue}} />
  <ul>
    {{#each this.contacts as |contact|}}
    {{#each this.filteredContacts as |contact|}}
      <li>
        <a class="active">
          <h4>{{contact.name}}</h4>
          <p>{{contact.email}}</p>
        </a>
      </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Now, whenever we type a value into the search bar it should update the list to
only show the contacts that match the value!

That's about it for our contact list component. Next, we'll create a details
section that displays when a user selects a contact from the list.
